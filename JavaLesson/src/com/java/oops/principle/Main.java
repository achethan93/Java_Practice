//This code can be optimised by declaring constant valuables as final - like length, breadth and radius
//using either int or float than a double for variable data types (depending on the application requirements)
//Use static methods: If a method does not need to access instance variables, it can be defined as a static method.
    // This allows the method to be called without creating an object of the class.
    // For example, you can make the rectangle method in the Rectangle class a static method, so that it can be called without creating a Rectangle object.
